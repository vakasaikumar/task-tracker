# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Task Tracker
### Project Description
Task Tracker is a simple React-based application designed to help users manage their daily tasks. It allows you to:

Add new tasks with specific details.
View all tasks in an organized format.
Edit task details.
Delete tasks when no longer needed.
The app uses React's useState for state management and local storage to persist tasks across sessions. It's styled with CSS for a clean and responsive user experience.

### Features
### Core Features
Add Task
Create tasks with:
Title (required)
Description (optional)
Due Date (required)
Status (Pending, In Progress, Completed)
View Tasks
Display all tasks in a table format with options to edit or delete.
Edit Task
Modify existing tasks using a pre-filled form.
Delete Task
Remove tasks with a confirmation prompt.
### Data Persistence
All task data is stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring tasks remain even after refreshing the page.
### Responsive Design
The application adapts to various screen sizes using CSS, making it mobile-friendly.
### Steps to Clone, Install, and Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository
To get a local copy of the project, run the following command in your terminal:
`git clone https:/githubcomyour-username/task-tracker.git
cd task-tracker` 
2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the necessary dependencies using npm:
`npm install`
3. Run the Application
Start the development server:
`npm start`
The application will launch in your default web browser at:
`http://localhost:3000`

### Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
CSS: For styling and responsive design.
Local Storage: For persisting data across browser sessions.
### Future Enhancements
Add filtering and sorting options (e.g., filter by status, sort by due date).
Implement a global state management system using useContext or Redux.
Include user authentication for personalized task tracking.
